def deconvolute (dataset):
    """Separates the single-moieties related events from the background in a given dataset.
    
    The average and standard deviation of the datset are calculated.
    Events are identified as datapoints that exceed the Poisson threshold, and are removed from the dataset:
    Threshold = average + 2.72 + 3.29*stdev
    The average and standard deviation of the resulting dataset are recalculated.
    the procedure repeats itself until there are no more datapoints to be excluded.
    
    Call it by typing:
    background, events, dissolved, dissolved_std, event_num, event_mean, event_std, loop_count, threshold = deconvolute(example)
    *'example' being the name of the preffered dataset.  
    
    Output: 
    background - A dataset containing the datapoints not identified as events.
    events - A dataset containing the datapoints identified as particles.
    dissolved - The average of the background dataset.
    dissolved_std - The standard deviation of the background dataset.
    event_num - The number of events.
    event_mean - The average of the events dataset.
    event_std - The standard deviation of the events dataset.
    loop_count - The number of times the procedure had to be applid before it reached the final dataset.
    threshold - The final threshold value.
